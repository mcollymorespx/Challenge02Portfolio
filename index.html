            <h2 class="section-title primary-border">ABOUT ME</h2>
            <a name="about-me">My name is Martin Collymore and I am an entry level Coding and Web Development student.  I have 25 years of proffesional work experience in sports and fitness.  My goal is to combine my sports experience with my understanding of coding and web development to produce tools to innovate youth coaching and athletics.  As an athlete I achieved success through hard work and commitment.  I've been named First Team All State in Texas high school baseball twice. I recieved a baseball scholarship to Concordia University at Austin where as a Junior I was named Student Athlete of the Year.  After graduation I signed a professional baseball contract with the Albany Gators of the American Southeast Association.  This July I will be inducted in to the St. Puis X High School Wall of Honor as an award givin to alumni that succeded in sports and served their Christian community through acts of kindness.  As a professional I've spent several years a Fitness Director at Lifetime Fitness.  As a fitness director I've been responsible for recruiting, hiring and training new employees.  Building successful teams and establishing a winning cultures in bussiness and athletics has been my lifes passion.  I look forward combining my learning of Web development and success in team building to become a vauluable member of a sports based Web Development company.</a>
